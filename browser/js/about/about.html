		<h2>SpellBook</h2>
	    <p>
	    	SpellBook is an interactive story book that teaches children basic programmatic logic, using fun story-lines and a unique drag-and-drop interface.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	   	 	We aim to address the gender gap in Computer Science by engaging girls in programming at a young age. Studies show that girls are more engaged in stories and characters, and so we built our app to reach the many children who are more literary-minded.  
	    </p>

	    <p>
	    	Each page in the book will further the storyline and present the child with a fun challenge that uses a basic piece of logic (such as if-statements, loops, etc).  
	    </p>

	    <p>	   
	    	Teachers, parents, and children can also track how they are doing on their user pages, as well as the teacher data page.

	    	This project was created by the Enigmasters of Fullstack Academy: Austin Shoecraft, Beckylee Dell, Chandra Galbiati, and Emily Sanford. We'd like to give special credit to Griffin and Ben for all their support, assistance, and puns.
